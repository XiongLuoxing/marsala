{"name":"Marsala","tagline":"For better future of people","body":"### What is Marsala?\r\nMarsala is a program that comprehensively detects variants (SNV and CNV) in PGS with linkage analysis.  \r\nMarsala runs on Linux.\r\n\r\n### What types of input can I use with Marsala?  \r\nMarsala is designed to work with reads from whole genome sequencing, although users have been successful in using Marsala with reads from specific region of genome.  \r\nIn general, Marsala uses sequencing information from three parts:  \r\n1. Disease-Grandparent or Disease-child (A)  \r\n2. Disease-parent (F)  \r\n3. Embryo (E)  \r\nIn addition, users can use sequencing information from polar body 1 (PB1) and polar body 2 (BP2) that corresponds to specific embryo, which will make result more accurate.\r\n\r\n### How does Marsala detect variants?  \r\n1. SNV <br />\r\nFirst, given specific genomic region (less than 2Mbp) Marsala detects SNVs for A, F and E (as well as PB1 and PB2) seperately. <br />\r\nThen, Marsala compares the genotypes between A amd F and infer which one of the chromosome homologous was passed from A to F. (i.e. risk genomic mate determination) <br />\r\nNext, Marsala compares the genotypes between F and E and estimate the ratio of risk passed sites to all passed sites. <br />\r\nFinally, Marsala determines whether this E obtains the risk genomic region which contains disease-related mutation. <br />\r\n\r\n2. CNV <br />\r\nMarsala estimate the DNA copy number of E and report whether E was normal.  \r\nThis protocol has been validated in following research: <br />  \r\nLiying Yan,  Lei Huang,  Liya Xu,  Jin Huang,  Fei Ma,  Xiaohui Zhu,  Yaqiong Tang,  Mingshan Liu, Ying Lian,  Ping Liu,  Rong Li,  Sijia Lu,  Fuchou Tang,  Jie Qiao,   X.
